		<h2> About Us</h2>
		<p> First bassanio is a reckless youth with no wisdom or thought for the future. He has spent whatever fortune he had instead of living within the scope of his financial means. He has nit learned from anything that has transpired before the play opens that may have contributed to the loss of all his financial resources. He pleads with his devoted friend Antonio to loan him money with which he can put on a show, a pretense of wealth to impress the fair Portia. </p>

			The ancient roman honour more appears<br> 
			Than in any that draws breath in Italy.<br>
			Antonio is a Christian who is very kind and large hearted. He hated the Jews and lent money gratis.  His bosom friend was bassanio who was a fortune- hunter.

The whole of the trial scene is rendered holy by the tender breathings of this friendship of Antonio. At last he was saved by the sagacity of Portia.</p>
